#### Example:  

This was a 3 week long project built when i was taking a udemy course on reactjs. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the Github  API based on what on  github usernaem been typed or searched for. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-5.2.0` and `ContextApi`.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was passing down props to components and it was difficult to do since i had alot of components  . This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into  ContextApi such as creatContext,useReducer,useContext and i was able to grasp the knowledge on statement such as the ContextApi to solve the prop drilling disaster.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 5.2.0, ContextApi, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
